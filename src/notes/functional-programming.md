One of our CMD teachers, Justus Sturkenboom, talked about the do's and dont's of the _functional programming_ paradigm. I found this lecture to be very inspiring because I like the functional way of programming in my own work.

I will certainly take some of the concepts into account in future project. I think that if you lean too much to functional programming that it'll just make your code more complex again... You can see my notes below.
