For our first guest lecture no other than Hidde de Vries popped up. Hidde is a freelance Front-end Developer who specializes in accessability.

He gave a talk about 'modernism in web design' and how that leads to having more of the same layouts. He also shed a light on working with grids in CSS and how we can make the web a bit more accessible.

Below you can see my notes from this lecture.
